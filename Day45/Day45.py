# Beautiful Soup is a Python library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages.
# It sits on top of an HTML or XML parser and provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
# Web scraping is used where we look through the underlying HTML code of a website to get hold of the information that we want.
