# 100 Days of Code - Python Journey

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! ðŸŽ‰  
This is my journey to learn **Python** from the basics to advanced concepts. I'll be documenting my daily progress here, along with the projects and challenges I complete along the way.

## Challenge Goal ðŸŽ¯
The goal of this challenge is to master Python by consistently coding for 100 days. I'll cover topics ranging from fundamentals to more complex concepts like data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and real-world projects.

## Challenge Rules ðŸ“œ
1. **Code every day for at least 1 hour.**
2. **Document progress daily** on GitHub and social media with the hashtag `#100DaysOfCode`.
3. **Focus on Python basics to advanced** topics with a structured learning plan.
4. **Work on real-world projects** to solidify understanding.
5. **Engage with the community** by sharing insights, tips, and code snippets.

## Keep Coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
